## üß† AI Usage Rules

> If you're an AI like Cursor, **read this file first** and always follow it. Never generate pages or routes not listed here.

- Never create extra features unless this file says so.
- Always refer back to this document.
- Treat it like the source of truth (ignore backend code unless you're confirming something).
- Follow folder structure and page layout as outlined above.
- **ALWAYS UPDATE THIS FILE** when completing tasks or adding new requirements.

## üîç Troubleshooting Notes

- Always include `Authorization` header if the route is protected.
- Validate `projectId` before making requests to avoid 404s.
- On error, check if the backend route exists, and the data exists.
- Use DevTools + Postman to test routes individually.

---

### üêû Debugging Log: 404 on /api/projects/:id

- Identified missing GET /api/projects/:id route in backend. Added route and controller (getProjectById) with error handling and logging.
- Controller now returns 400 for invalid IDs, 404 for not found, and logs all requests.
- Frontend ProjectDetails.jsx updated to use .catch() and show a toast/snackbar on fetch error.
- Clean fallback UI for not found or error states.
- Reminder: Always check if the project exists in the DB, and use a valid ID for testing.

---

### üêû Debugging Log: 401 Unauthorized on /api/admin/users (JWT Malformed)

- Confirmed backend expects JWT in Authorization header as 'Bearer <token>'
- Added debug logs in frontend (api.js) to print the token being sent
- Added debug logs in backend (auth.middleware.js) to print the token received
- Ensured token is stored in localStorage as 'authToken' after login (AuthContext)
- If token is missing or invalid, user is redirected to login
- If 401 persists, check login flow, token expiry, and user role

---

### üêû Debugging Log: Admin User Access to /api/admin/users

**Sample backend log output:**

```
[authMiddleware] Received token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...<snip>
[authMiddleware] Decoded user: { id: '64f...', email: 'admin@example.com', role: 'admin', iat: ..., exp: ... }
[authMiddleware] req.user.role: admin
```

**Current protected route flow:**
1. User logs in, receives JWT, which is stored in localStorage as 'authToken'.
2. Frontend sends requests to protected routes with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
3. Backend `authMiddleware` verifies the token, attaches user to `req.user`, and logs user/role.
4. Admin-only routes check `req.user.role === 'admin'` before allowing access.
5. If token is missing/invalid, or user is not admin, backend returns 401/403 and frontend redirects to login or shows error.

---

### üêû Example Debug Output: Successful Admin Request

```
[authMiddleware] Start
[authMiddleware] Received token: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...<snip>
[authMiddleware] Decoded user: { id: '...', email: 'admin@example.com', role: 'admin', ... }
[authMiddleware] req.user.role: admin
[projectAuthMiddleware] Start
[projectAuthMiddleware] req.user: { ... }
[projectAuthMiddleware] req.project: { ... }
[ownerAuthMiddleware] Start
[ownerAuthMiddleware] req.user: { ... }
[ownerAuthMiddleware] req.project: { ... }
[admin.routes] req.user: { ... }
```

### üìù Why Missing authMiddleware Causes 401

If `authMiddleware` is not applied before `projectAuthMiddleware` and `ownerAuthMiddleware`, then `req.user` is never set. Since both downstream middlewares and admin route handlers rely on `req.user` for permission checks, this results in 401 Unauthorized errors. By adding `authMiddleware` first, the JWT is validated, the user is attached to `req.user`, and the rest of the authorization chain can function as intended.
